About:
MATLAB codes to calculate the scattering, absorption and extinction coefficients of pristine as well as coated spheres using the resonance conditions for Mie Scattering. 

Requirements:
You need to have MATLAB software installed in your system.

Uses:
We have provided the step-by-step procedure in the comment lines of each code. The usage of each available code is summarized below.


(1) Cal_Mie.m: The function generates the scattering, absorption and extinction coefficients for a given incident wavelength, when the boundary conditions of a pristine sphere has been satisfied.

(2) Cal_Mie_coated.m: The function generates the scattering, absorption and extinction coefficients for a given incident wavelength, when the boundary conditions of a coated core-shell sphere has been satisfied.

(3) Mie_IK.m: Code for Mie scattering calculation of pristine spheres.

(4) Mie_IK_coated.m: Code for Mie scattering calculation of coted spheres.
